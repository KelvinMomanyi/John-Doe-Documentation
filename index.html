It also includes a custom script (`app.js`) for additional functionality like preloader, smooth scrolling, filtering portfolio items, etc.</p>
            <h4>External Libraries:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1. jQuery: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.</li>
                <li>2. Popper.js: A positioning engine to make tooltips and popovers work.</li>
                <li>3. Bootstrap: A popular front-end framework for building responsive websites.</li>
                <li>4. Waypoints: A library that makes it easy to execute a function whenever you scroll to an element.</li>
                <li>5. Owl Carousel: A responsive carousel slider plugin.</li>
                <li>6. Filterizr: A jQuery plugin for sorting, filtering, and shuffling grid items.</li>
                <li>7. AOS (Animate On Scroll): A library to animate elements as they scroll into view.</li>
                <li>8. Tilt.js: A tiny requestAnimationFrame powered 60+fps lightweight parallax tilt effect for jQuery.</li>
                <li>9. Typed.js: A JavaScript library that types out sentences or strings of text.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The JavaScript libraries have been used to add interactivity to the website. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Preloader Animation: The preloader animation is removed once the window has fully loaded.</li>
                <li>2. Sticky Navigation: The navigation bar becomes sticky (fixed to the top) after scrolling down a certain distance. The `hideNav` function is used to show or hide the navigation bar based on the scroll direction.</li>
                <li>3. Typed.js: This library is used to create a typing effect in the header, cycling through different strings like "John Doe", "a Developer", "a Designer", and "a Businessman".</li>
                <li>4. Progress Bars: When the section with the ID `exp-id` scrolls into view, the progress bars animate to their respective widths to indicate skill levels.</li>
                <li>5. Owl Carousel: This initializes an Owl Carousel for the testimonial section, making it autoplay with a timeout of 4 seconds.</li>
                <li>6. Filterizr: This library is used to filter and sort the portfolio items with animation.</li>
                <li>7. Navbar Toggle: This code toggles the visibility of the navbar and overlay when the navbar toggler button is clicked.</li>
            </ul>
